**Title: Simple Random Keygen**

**Description:**

This repository contains my first web-based application, "Simple Random Keygen," a tool I developed to generate secure, random passwords. As a beginner in programming, I initially created the core functionality in Python and later transitioned to web development using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, with guidance from ChatGPT and various online tutorials.

The application features a user-friendly interface where users can specify the number and length of the passwords they need. Each password is generated randomly using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, ensuring a high level of security and unpredictability.
